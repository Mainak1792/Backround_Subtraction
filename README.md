# Backround_Subtraction
## Problem Statement : 
- A robust video surveillance system does not depend only on the careful placements of cameras but is also robust to whatever is in its visual field or whatever lighting effects occur.
- It should be capable of dealing with movement through cluttered areas, objects overlapping in the visual field, shadows, lighting changes, effects of moving elements of the scene (e.g. swaying trees), slow-moving objects, and objects being introduced or removed from the scene.
- A standard method is effective in situations where objects move continuously and the background is visible a significant portion of the time, it is not robust to scenes with many moving objects particularly if they move slowly. It also cannot handle bimodal backgrounds, recovers slowly when the background is uncovered and has a single, predetermined threshold for the entire scene.
