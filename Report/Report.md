## Aim
Use the idea of motion segmentation, from the papers below. To segment out the foreground, you may use the Sequential Labelling algorithm. Or K-Means, for that matter. Please generate two videos (in terms of the frames, and the video file as well) -
- the background, and
- one with the foreground objects
## Assumptions
We have only experimented on the template video. The parameters which we have experimented upon is limited to this video only. [Link](assets\umcp.mpg)
The parameters are as follows:
- Learning Rate
- Threshold
- Variance
- Weight
